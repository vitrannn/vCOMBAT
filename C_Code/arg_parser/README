Description

Arg_parser is an argument parser that follows POSIX and GNU conventions
for command line arguments. There exist C++ and C versions of
Arg_parser. The C++ version is implemented as a C++ class, while the C
version is implemented as a single struct plus associated functions.
Both are simpler, easier to use, and safer that 'getopt_long'.

For maximum stability, Arg_parser is self-contained. It extracts all the
information it needs from its arguments to avoid refering to them later.
This avoids index-out-of-bounds errors.

Arg_parser does not modify its arguments, nor uses any global variables.
So you may create more than one parser in your program if you need or
want to.

The C++ version of Arg_parser can also parse options from configuration
files.

To use Arg_parser in your own programs simply copy the files
'arg_parser.h' and 'arg_parser.cc' (or 'carg_parser.h' and
'carg_parser.c' for the C version) in your source tree. See also the
file 'main.cc' ('cmain.c') for an example of use.
